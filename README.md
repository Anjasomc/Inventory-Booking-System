<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Docker

The Docker image is the simplest way to get started. The image comes with a self-signed SSL certificate.

First create config and storage directories on the host to persist data. Then run:

<pre><code>docker run -d --name booking -v <mark>/local/config</mark>:/etc/inventory-booking-system/config -v <mark>/local/storage</mark>:/var/www/html/storage -p 443:443 angusmcd/inventory-booking-system:latest</code></pre>

The server will now be available at [https://localhost](https://localhost).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### [Loans](https://github.com/Inventory-Booking-System/Inventory-Booking-System/wiki/Loans) 

* Loans are a list of bookable assets between two time periods, either over part of the day or multiple days. Loans can be booked in advance or done when equipment is collected.

* Emails are sent to users upon creation of a loan as well as on return and when the loan is overdue.

* Assets in loans can be partially booked back in

### [Setups](https://github.com/Inventory-Booking-System/Inventory-Booking-System/wiki/Setups)

* Setups have a similar to loans but will also notify the user when a setup is upcoming in the next 30 minutes. This is useful for departments which have to do regular setups such as setting up av equipment.

### [Incidents](https://github.com/Inventory-Booking-System/Inventory-Booking-System/wiki/Incidents)

* The incident module is used to keep track of any damage done to equipment. You can list different types of equipment and assign cost to them.

* You can setup distribution groups which allows you to email a certain set of users when an incident occurs.
